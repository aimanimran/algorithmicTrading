The S&P 500 is a stock market index, used to track the top 500 most popular stocks. A company's valuation, specifically the market cap value, controls how much influence it has on the index's performance. This project is to create an S&P 500 fund that is unweighted, including companies equally regardless of size in relation to each other.
